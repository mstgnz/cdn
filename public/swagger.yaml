        **WARNING: This is a synchronous operation - the client must wait during the entire download process.**
        
        For large files or background processing, use the async download endpoint instead:
        `POST /aws/glacier/{vault}/jobs/{jobId}/async-download`
        
        **Use Cases:**
        - Small files (< 100MB)
        - Immediate download required
        - Simple one-time operations
        
        **Not Recommended For:**
        - Large files (> 100MB)
        - Production environments with high load
        - Unreliable network connections
        
        Only works if the Glacier retrieval job is completed.

      summary: Start async Glacier archive download (Asynchronous)
      description: |
        Starts an asynchronous download job for a completed Glacier retrieval.
        **This is an asynchronous operation - the client receives a job ID immediately and can track progress.**
        
        The file will be downloaded in the background to MinIO or local storage.
        Use the download job ID to track progress.
        
        **Advantages:**
        - Non-blocking operation
        - Suitable for large files
        - Background processing
        - Queue management
        - Retry mechanism
        
        **Recommended For:**
        - Large files (> 100MB)
        - Production environments
        - Batch operations
        - Integration workflows
