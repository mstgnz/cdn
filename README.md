## CDN API with MinIO and Aws
#### Create your own Cdn service on Minio and Aws.

### Overview

This project allows you to create your own Content Delivery Network (CDN) service using MinIO and AWS S3. You can use this CDN service to upload, retrieve, and delete files.

### Prerequisites

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): You will need Docker to run this project.
* [Aws S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/): In this project s3 backup is currently used (optional)
* [Minio](https://min.io/docs/minio/container/index.html): The project runs entirely on Minio.
* [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php): currently only resize feature is active. Only image files


### Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mstgnz/cdn.git
```
2- Rename the .env.example file to .env and enter the required information.
3- Start the project with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
OR
```bash
make
```

Now, you can access the following services:
* MinIO: http://localhost:9001
* Go API: http://localhost:9090


### Usage
- All usage: From the [Swagger UI](http://localhost:9090/swagger) user interface you can see and try all the uses. Or you can review [swagger.yaml](/public/swagger.yaml).
- You can submit width and height if you want it to be resized during upload. If you send only width, the height will be assigned proportionally. If you send only the height, the width will be assigned proportionally. The resizing process is optional.
- Get: if you use only width, height = will be proportioned according to the original size. If you use only height, width = will be proportioned according to the original size.
