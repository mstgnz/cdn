# Contributing to CDN Service

We love your input! We want to make contributing to CDN Service as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
2. Update the docs/ with any new documentation.
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer.

## Code Style

- Follow Go best practices and style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use proper error handling

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Include integration tests where necessary
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Bug Reports

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)

## Feature Requests

We love feature requests! When submitting a feature request, please:

1. Check if the feature already exists
2. Provide a clear description of the feature
3. Explain why this feature would be useful
4. Be open to feedback and discussion
